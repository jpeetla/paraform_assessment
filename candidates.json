This showed ads in the tweet conversation threads for the first time and enabled new revenue streams with significant impacts. \n \n4. Compact Image App Ads. This introduced a new UI to boost user engagement. I was the project lead of this project. In addition to the regular tasks as an iOS engineer, I was also responsible for cross functional collaboration, weekly milestone reviews, and hosting standup and retrospective meetings.","location":"San Francisco Bay Area","employment_type":"FULL_TIME","company":{"name":"Twitter ","id":"clfmp2ija000sl50f1q5gri38","logo_src":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQEJZABhJ-eE0g/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1690242317195/twitter_logo?e=1738195200&v=beta&t=wrNl2E4PoqqzItVqnP_orJJQPbbTY3NuQ9UYzDlG_2A"}},{"id":"cm2p013t90012jy0cf5085ezf","role_title":"Software Engineer II","start_date":"2020-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","end_date":"2021-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","description":"(same as above)","location":null,"employment_type":"FULL_TIME","company":{"name":"Twitter ","id":"clfmp2ija000sl50f1q5gri38","logo_src":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQEJZABhJ-eE0g/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1690242317195/twitter_logo?e=1738195200&v=beta&t=wrNl2E4PoqqzItVqnP_orJJQPbbTY3NuQ9UYzDlG_2A"}},{"id":"cm2p013ub0014jy0cw1uoji7j","role_title":"Software Engineer II (MoPub)","start_date":"2019-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","end_date":"2020-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","description":"I worked on the open source MoPub iOS SDK, which enabled advertisers and app publishers to monetize with ads served by MoPub or other ad networks.
