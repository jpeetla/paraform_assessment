We invest in each other and love seeing each other succeed.</p></li><li><p><strong><u>Build the blueprint</u>:</strong> We simplify complex problems in writing to create clarity. Clarity aligns our teams, sharpens our decision-making, and accelerates execution.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong><u>More wood, fewer arrows</u>:</strong> We prioritize ruthlessly and throw our weight into only the projects that matter. We finish what we start.</p></li><li><p><strong><u>Give a damn</u>:</strong> We’re determined to leave our mark and hold ourselves and each other to high standards. We’re craftspeople at heart, and we enjoy the rigor and discipline required to perform at a high level.</p></li><li><p><strong><u>Start with the customer</u>:</strong> We are voracious students of our customers’ problems. We celebrate only when our customers celebrate.</p></li></ul><p></p><p><strong>Remote vs in-office work</strong></p><p>We believe that great people can do great work from the office or from home. Roughly half of Mitosaurs work from our SF and NYC offices, with the rest working remotely.

Miter <em><u>is</u></em> a great fit for those who take pride in their craft and want to accelerate their career growth. That said:</p><ul><li><p>Mitosaurs are evaluated based on output and results, not input or hours worked. Miter is a high-trust culture, which means we trust Mitosaurs to work where, when, and how they want.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Miter should never interfere with health and happiness.

Today, GovWell is used to process permit and license applications for everything from new affordable housing developments to small business licenses.\n\n- Enabling a Figma-style document review experience that helps governments easily collaborate to review, mark up, and approve technical documents such as building and development plans.\n\n- Developing a flexible and powerful document generation system to automatically generate official documents including permits and licenses for thousands of unique processes (think: Canva for documents).\n\n- Creating a payments experience that makes it easy for citizens to pay billions in annual permit/license fees, property taxes, and utility bills online.","teamAbout":"<p><strong><u>Who are we?</u></strong></p><p>Our mission is deeply personal for us. Ben Cohen, Co-founder and CTO, grew up helping his father — a general contractor — to apply for hundreds of construction permits. Ben’s experiences navigating clunky, outdated government websites inspired him to build better solutions for the millions of tradespeople whose livelihoods depend on getting permits fast. Prior to founding GovWell, Ben worked for Uber and Amazon as a Software Engineer, and earned his AB in Computer Science <em>summa cum laude </em>from Princeton.</p><p></p><p>Troy LeCaire, Co-founder and CEO, was employee #1 and Chief of Staff at RippleMatch, a B2B SaaS company, helping it grow from 0 to $10M in annual revenue and a $200M valuation. Before RippleMatch, he worked for two senators from his home state of Wisconsin. He believes passionately in the potential for technology to help government work more effectively for citizens everywhere. Troy earned his BA in Government <em>magna cum laude</em><strong><em> </em></strong>from Cornell.</p><p></p><p><strong><u>Core Values</u></strong></p><p><strong>Striving</strong></p><p>We believe a good life means striving vigorously towards difficult goals that are personally meaningful and challenge us to become the best version of ourselves. We are uncomfortable with stasis and constantly seek to improve. We value colleagues who inspire and motivate us.</p><p></p><p><strong>Public Service</strong></p><p>We believe that citizens deserve effective and transparent government, and that good technology products are necessary to advance this goal. We take pride in building products that benefit society. Given our position, we have a special responsibility to do excellent work and to prioritize the public interest in our decision-making.</p><p></p><p><strong>Exceptionalism</strong></p><p>We believe small teams of exceptional people can do great things. We only hire people who are among the top 1% at what they do, and we hold each other to this same standard.</p><p></p><p><strong>Humility</strong></p><p>We believe that people are inherently fallible, and what matters more than avoiding mistakes is how we respond to them. When we make a mistake or are unsure, we own it fully. We actively solicit criticism and feedback from others in order to improve.</p><p></p><p><strong>Be Direct</strong></p><p>We believe that it’s important to be direct with each other because doing so builds trust, respect, and empowers people to make better decisions. We are proactive about sharing our thoughts and feelings, especially when it may be uncomfortable. We praise great work generously, and share constructive feedback calmly and empathetically.</p>"}},{"id":"clxkz3vpe0069kx0cj6pgskqi","name":"Senior Software Engineer, Growth","description":"<p>As a member of AtoB's engineering team, you will be instrumental in revolutionizing the payments infrastructure for the trucking and logistics industry.

The philosophy is to hire people with a track record of building and ambition to code every day and are willing to learn sometimes difficult systems like payments operations, ledgers, corporate cards, etc. If they're willing to learn these things and also are willing to commit to the codebase every day, they'd be a great candidate.\n\nWe want someone ready for the next step in their career, with a commensurate step up in agency, ownership, and equity. This is a very high reward role, as we'd ask this person to make important engineering decisions, be the go-to on most engineering contributions, and also be a POC for integration with various customers.\n\nA previous experience at either a startup or big tech company where they've shown some initiative and the ability to go above and beyond when needed is great. Along with potentially some side projects/their ability to learn new tools and become proficient at coding quickly.

None of the problems we'll face within our startup are abstract and all problems will be solved with code being shipped.\n\nThis candidate doesn't need to have worked at a startup before, but hopefully, they've read about or embraced the startup methodology of moving quickly and committing fully to the changes that can happen quickly within a startup. Especially being very customer and product-focused. \n\nThis person should be able to ask themselves hard questions surrounding product decisions and implementation. Because they are our first founding engineer, this person will have little managerial oversight, which should excite them. Instead, this is a very collaborative role where they'll be working closely with the founders. They should be thinking every day about customer outcomes and how to ship code that furthers what our customers need. The ability, agency, and ownership to ask these questions of themselves are crucial to being successful in this role.\n\nThe final thing to add is that this person should always have an innate desire for urgency.

In that spirit, we're valuing someone who is willing to work hard, code every day, and likes to learn!

There’s no such thing as perfect, but there is such thing as the constant pursuit of greatness. We keep each other accountable to this every day.\n\n● **First Principles Thinking**\n\nYou should have a good reason for why you are doing what you’re doing.\n\n● **Anti-Mimeticism**\n\nRelated to the above, you should not being doing things because of external hype. Your decisions ideally are made on your own understanding of the world around you. Everyone in AI right now is extremely mimetic - moving from one thing to another. We must focus and be grounded on the reasons that are driving our actions.\n\n● **Customer Obsession**\n\nWe appreciate individuals who create products that address real problems. They have empathy, and thus usually good communication skills. UX & design are top priorities in this company because we want the experience of using Delphi to be extremely delightful and intuitive for our users.\n\n● **Good Quests > Bad Quests**\n\nWe want to have a net positive impact on people’s lives.\n\n● **In Person**\n\nThe best company cultures, and relationships, are built in person.\n\n● **High Velocity & High Quality**\n\nWe are using velocity here intentionally. Speed is the absolute value of velocity - we want to move quickly but in the correct direction. We cannot sacrifice quality for speed - we must have both.\n\n**Who We're Looking For**:\n\n● **Outcasts & people with chips on their shoulders.**\n\nThese are the people who feel like they still have something to prove. The people from non-traditional backgrounds. Those who think differently. Sam and I view ourselves as outcasts, and we are both heavily motivated to make this work. There is no plan B.\n\n● **Ability to thrive in uncertainty.**\n\nWe are building in the curiosity phase of a new technology. Things will constantly change, and you have to be ok, even relish, in the ups and downs and uncertainties of innovating in an entirely new field.\n\nA company’s trajectory is baked in after the **first 10 employees**, so it’s important to us that we build a culture of people who are aligned upon the same values and mission. Obviously, we are early and things will change, but as long as we have a strong foundation, we can grow fast and tall in the long run.\n\nAn analogy I like to use: for the first couple of years of its life, bamboo stays under 3 feet. It builds a strong foundation so that in the future, it can grow incredibly fast in a short period of time. Right now, we are focused on building that bamboo foundation.","avoid_traits":["High ego.

They won't just be working on 'easy' problems, internal tools or small features, they'll be given complex/difficult tasks to solve and drive the entire company and product forward.\n● As you can probably tell from the expectations of this role, there is a high chance that a candidate will be a great fit if they were previously a founding engineer or a relatively early employee at a fast-growing startup during Seed - Series C stages.\n● Being an ex-founder or working on their own projects is also a great signal.\n● **This role is NOT for everyone**. If you think a potential candidate is just looking for another job and they don't really care what company they are joining as long as pay & hours are good, we strongly suggest against submitting them. They might have a decent resume but there is an incredibly low chance they'll get hired and will likely go nowhere after 1 interview. It'll be a waste of time for you, the candidate, and our company. \n● We also found that typically engineers who are more junior in their career are a better fit for founding engineer.

However today, measurement, reporting, and verification of soil carbon sequestration is not cost effective, accurate, or scalable. This prevents large-scale climate finance from being deployed to rapidly scale soil carbon improvement despite its massive potential to combat climate change, improve food security, and alleviate extreme poverty. \n\nTerradot is building a global measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) platform to accelerate high-integrity carbon removal and storage around the world. With Stanford’s Soil and Environmental Biogeochemistry Lab, we leverage technological innovation using ground truth sampling, remote sensing, and AI modeling to accurately and scalably measure soil carbon. For soil carbon project developers, Terradot decreases the time, cost, and complexity of MRV while increasing the integrity of the carbon removal credits for carbon buyers. This enables large-scale deployment of climate finance to incentivize the adoption of sustainable practices. We are focused on improving soil health in emerging economies to maximize global sequestration and community impact.\n\nWe are a public-benefit corporation driven by passion and purpose in service to our planet, people, and prosperity. Terradot is backed by world-class investors including Floodgate, John Doerr, Kleiner Perkins, Sheryl Sandberg, Ponderosa Ventures, 776 Foundation (Alexis Ohanian), George Roberts, and Stanford’s TomKat Center for Sustainable Energy.

It's incredibly challenging but also fulfilling. \n\nRecruiting a founding engineer, especially for a stealth startup like us without much public presence can be difficult, so here are some tips I think would help you when sourcing and pitching candidates:\n\n● Pitch to candidates that being a founding engineer is not only a fulfilling experience where they get to work at a fast-growing startup but also an incredibly strong signal that will be on their resume forever. Having been hiring managers before, we know every company would want to hire someone who was a founding engineer.\n● Being able to have complete ownership of the work they do and how high-impact it is. They won't just be working on 'easy' problems, internal tools or small features, they'll be given complex/difficult tasks to solve and drive the entire company and product forward.\n● As you can probably tell from the expectations of this role, there is a high chance that a candidate will be a great fit if they were previously a founding engineer or a relatively early employee at a fast-growing startup during Seed - Series C stages.\n● Being an ex-founder or working on their own projects is also a great signal.\n● We also found that typically engineers who are more junior in their career are a better fit for founding engineer. The right candidate for this role will likely have closer to 2-4 years experience, no more than 6 years.\n● Here is some more info you can share on why working at Merlin is great: \n <a href=\"https://twitter.com/itsalfredw/status/1698448407835422996?s=20\" target=\"_blank\"><u>**Why join Merlin?**</u></a>","avoid_traits":[],"benefits":[],"tech_stack":[],"locations":[],"company":{"name":"Merlin","description":"Everyone hates surveys.

Below I'll outline our philosophy for recruiting, what we prioritize, and who we look to bring onto the team. You can also read a bit more here (https://www.complete.so/blog/hiring-in-ai-principles-from-arena-ai). You can also look at the current team here (https://www.arena-ai.com/about). We're backed by Founders Fund, Initialized Capital, and Goldcrest Capital. \n\n**Recruiting Priorities:**\n● Above all else, we look for people who have excelled compared to their peers, and have had a sharp upward trajectory in their career.\n● We care about the amount of ownership candidates have taken on in their roles. Regardless of the technical rigor of the tasks they may have completed in their roles, if they were not given ownership and responsibility of the outcome and consequences of that work, they will not be a good fit for Arena. We give engineers a high degree of autonomy to problem solve across a broad range of projects, and we need to trust that incoming candidates understand that ownership and have successfully executed on high impact outcomes before. \n● We want candidates who have experience building 0-1, meaning that they have taken something from ideation to architecture, actually built/deployed it themselves, and have owned the consequences of that effort, ideally resulting in revenue impact for their company. This ideally comes from experience in growing startups, but does not necessarily have to. \n\n**Arena's Culture:**\n● We have a very high performance, very low ego culture. We will never hire a candidate who is technically brilliant if they are not sincerely humble, willing to learn from people with less experience, willing to admit when they are wrong, and own their mistakes. \n● We work hard. The technical and commercial problems we're solving are inherently very challenging, and part of our differentiation as a company working with enterprises is that we are willing to do the difficult, gritty work to win relationships and revenue that other companies are not willing to do. There will absolutely be times when engineers work late nights for a week or two, but that is certainly not consistent. That being said, we have unlimited PTO and people use it. We trust people to execute at the highest level, and take care of themselves. \n● We have high conviction in what we're building. Arena was founded over 4 years ago on the belief that transformers can provide enormous impact in decision autonomy for the enterprise, we are not part of the wave of recent AI hype. We know that not every candidate will be an ML diehard following the industry for years, but we expect them to have deeper conviction than \"AI is the future.\" If the candidate can't articulate specifically why they're excited to be involved in AI/ML, they are not for us. \n● We believe in the power of face time. We work in person with each other 5 days a week (of course, people work from home when they need to). Our scientists and engineers travel globally to meet customers and users, understand their pain points, and learn more about their world to build better products.\n● We actually enjoy working with each other, and we only hire people we're genuinely excited to work with. We screen out candidates who are not great collaborators/communicators immediately. \n\n**General Notes:** \n● FAANG engineers generally do not make it through our interview process (it's not very long, but the bar is high). We have some success with Amazon engineers, but candidates from Meta and Google have never made it through the process. \n● Please do not submit candidates you have only interacted with on LinkedIn / email and don't have a real relationship with. \n● We will not change or adapt the interview process for any candidate, outside of considerations for disabilities. \n● We will not match what FAANG candidates get offered. If candidates don't accept that they'll likely have a lower base than they would at FAANG, they shouldn't interview.\n● If a candidate has built around ML or built ML models, please have them list the types of models and techniques they've used (e.g. were they building/using convolutional neural nets, recurrent neural nets, transformers,  reinforcement learning, active learning, supervised / unsupervised learning, etc).\n\n**Selling Points:**\n● We are a Series A, but we're much further along the journey than most Series A companies. We were revenue positive before our Series A, and continue to be very revenue focused and financially healthy.\n● There is a very small group of companies who have successfully closed multi-million dollar enterprise deals in AI - Scale, Anduril, Applied Intution, and us (I'm not a market expert, I could be missing one or two). \n● Our founders are pragmatic about the business - we let revenue dictate when we grow, and are strategic about heading headcount to the team. We're building Arena as a fundamentally sustainable venture, not depending on venture capital for survival.

For true self-serve analytics, you need to enable business stakeholders to become “writers” of data. If I’m on the revenue operations team and I need a new piece of information to make a decision, I need to talk to the data team to get that data, even though there are a hundred dashboards that use a lot of that underlying data. Ultimately, this leads to business stakeholders like sales teams moving much more slowly than they should be. \n\nA business user should be able to describe the information they want and just get that data back. We’re making this possible. We’re starting by building tools to make it easy for data teams to codify institutional knowledge and perform analyses without having to maintain unwieldy documentation.

I studied Computer Science, Computational Finance, and Robotics at Carnegie Mellon University. After 2.5 years, I dropped out to start my first company, Vectordash. We went through Y Combinator (W19) and grew it to over $100k ARR. I eventually shut the company down because I wasn’t excited about the long-term vision and the prospects for unit economics. I then started working on other projects I was excited about. \n\nI then started Covalent in 2021 with my former co-founder David, and we saw a lot of traction with the product we built, and sold into a number of popular communities and some large enterprises. We raised a round of pre-seed funding and built out a small team to iterate towards product-market fit. We decided to pivot away from Covalent a few months ago because we realized the problem we were solving was a low priority for HR teams, and we wouldn’t be able to build the venture scale business we were targeting.
